## Overview
This repository contains our experiments and findings with the Time2Vec model. Time2Vec's core advantage lies in its ability to represent temporal aspects in data, making it a potentially powerful tool for time series analysis.

## Key Challenges
- **Model Tuning**: Tuning Time2Vec involves selecting suitable periodic functions and determining the right embedding dimensions.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: A significant challenge encountered was the need for dimensionality reduction, which was not initially addressed.
- **Exploding Dimensionality**: Complex models suffer from rapidly increasing dimensionality, which poses a computational challenge.

## Opportunities
- **Alternative Models**: Exploration of different models could yield better results.
- **Space for Experimentation**: Despite the challenges, there are ample opportunities for further experimentation and exploration in this domain.
